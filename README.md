# CSC (Cascading style component)


This Framework plans to cover only the important and necessary tags, as well as necessary styles, on the other hand, this Framework is oriented to a 2 typography design, the japanese language and the western typography (english, spanish). Also this Framework is based on Bootstrap.

The updates will be published little by little and will not follow a specific order, so some styles will not be prioritized, for example: Styles for the mobile version, or very specific styles.

> Feel free to Fork and add things if you want to add more styles or fix existing ones.
